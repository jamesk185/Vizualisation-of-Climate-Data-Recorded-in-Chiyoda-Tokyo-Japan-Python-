### Overview:

- Written and programmed with Python using Jupyter Notebook.
- Data processing and cleaning.
- Data visualization.

### Background:

How have air temperature, total precipitation and relative humidity changed in Chiyoda, Japan over the last century and how do they compare to Michigan, USA?

With the primary focus being on Chiyoda, Tokyo, I will take a broad look at changes in climate condition over the last century in three key areas; air temperature, precipitation and humidity. For means of comparison and further interesting insight, and with the course being conducted by University of Michigan, I will include the air temperature and precipitation data for Ann Arbor, Michigan.
